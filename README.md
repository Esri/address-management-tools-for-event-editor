# address-management-tools-for-event-editor

The address management tools for the Event Editor app are used to collect and manage address block ranges, site addresses, and related mailing address data. 
They can be used by planning, public safety, or land records organizations to streamline the collection, maintenance, and use of authoritative address information. 
The Esri Roads and Highways address management tools support the ArcGIS for Local Government data model.
